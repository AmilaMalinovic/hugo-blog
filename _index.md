Hi, I am Amila Malinovic. I am currently looking for a position as Data Scientist in the region of Paris.

I started my studies with a bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, followed by a master’s degree in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics and ending with a master’s degree in Data Science.

My previous professional experience as a scientific project manager in Paris provided me a strong coding skills and a rigorous scientific approach. During my last experience, I developed analytical capabilities and boosted my mathematical skills.

Enthusiasm by data and willing to consolidate my skills in data science, I decide to create this website.
